### Objective

This project contains the notebook spam_detector.ipynb to test the logistical regression and random forest classifier on data related to spam.  Of the 4601 entries, 2788 were classified as 0 (not spam) and 1813 was classified as 1 (spam) indicating an imbalanced data set. The data is split into two parts with 25% of the data for testing and and 75% of the data for training. The independent variables X is normalized be before testing and fitting with the models. The Logistic Regression model resulted in an accuracy score of 93%, while running the Random Forest Classifier model using the same data set resulted in a slightly higher accuracy score of 94%.
